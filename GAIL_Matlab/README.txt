Downloads
------------
GAIL can be downloaded from http://gailgithub.github.io/GAIL_Dev/.

Alternatively, you can get a local copy of the GAIL repository with
this command:

  git clone https://github.com/GailGithub/GAIL_Dev.git


Requirements
------------

You will need to install MATLAB 7 or a later version.


Documentation
-------------

Detailed documentation is available at GAIL_Matlab/Documentation.


General Usage Notes
-------------------

GAIL version 2.2 includes the following eight algorithms:

1.  funappx_g: One-dimensional function approximation on bounded interval

2.  funmin_g: global minimum value of univariate function on a closed interval

3.  integral_g: One-dimensional integration on bounded interval

4.  meanMC_g: Monte Carlo method for estimating mean of a random variable

5.  cubMC_g: Monte Carlo method for numerical multiple integration

6.  cubSobol_g: Quasi-Monte Carlo method using Sobol' cubature for d-dimensional integration

7.  cubLattice_g: Quasi-Monte Carlo method using rank-1 Lattices cubature for d-dimensional integration

8.  meanMC_CLT: Monte Carlo method with Central Limit Theorem (CLT) confidence intervals for estimating mean of a random variable



Installation Instruction
------------------------

1.  Unzip the contents of the zip file to a directory and maintain the
    existing directory and subdirectory structure. (Please note: If you
    install into the "toolbox" subdirectory of the MATLAB program
    hierarchy, you will need to click the button "Update toolbox path
    cache" from the File/Preferences... dialog in MATLAB.)

2.  In MATLAB, add the GAIL directory to your path. This can be done
    by running "GAIL_Install.m".  Alternatively, this can be done by
    selecting "File/Set Path..." from the main or Command window
    menus, or with the command "pathtool". We recommend that you
    select the "Save" button on this dialog so that GAIL is on the
    path automatically in future MATLAB sessions.

3.  To check if you have installed GAIL successfully, type "help
    funappx_g" to see if its documentation shows up.

Alternatively, you could do this:

1.  Download DownloadInstallGail_2_2.m and put it where you want
    GAIL to be installed.

2.  Execute it in MATLAB.

To uninstall GAIL, execute "GAIL_Uninstall".

To reinstall GAIL, execute "GAIL_Install".

Tests
-----

We provide quick doctests for each of the functions above. To run
doctests in funappx_g, for example, issue the command doctest
funappx_g.

We also provide unit tests for MATLAB version 8 or later. To run unit
tests for funmin_g, for instance, execute run(ut_funmin_g).

Known Bugs
----------
None.
