%% Installation Instructions
%
% 1.  Unzip the contents of the zip file to a directory and maintain the
%     existing directory and subdirectory structure. (Please note: If you
%     install into the *toolbox* subdirectory of the MATLAB program
%     hierarchy, you will need to click the button "Update toolbox path
%     cache" from the File/Preferences... dialog in MATLAB.)
% 
% 2.  In MATLAB, add the GAIL directory to your path. This can be done
%     by running *GAIL_Install.m*.  Alternatively, this can be done by
%     selecting *File/Set Path...* from the main or Command window
%     menus, or with the command *pathtool*. We recommend that you
%     select the "Save" button on this dialog so that GAIL is on the
%     path automatically in future MATLAB sessions.
% 
% 3.  To check if  GAIL is installed successfully, type *help
%     funappx_g* to see if its documentation shows up.
% 
% Alternatively, you could do this:
% 
% 1.  Download DownloadInstallGail_2_2.m and put it where you want
%     GAIL to be installed.
% 
% 2.  Execute it in MATLAB.
% 
% To uninstall or reinstall GAIL, execute *GAIL_Uninstall*. To reinstall 
% GAIL, execute *GAIL_Install*.
