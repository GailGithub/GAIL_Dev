%% Release Notes 
%
% GAIL Version 2.3.1, 2020.
% 
%% Major changes in algorithms
%
% In this release, we have a new algorithm called *CubBayesNet_g*. Similar to
% cubBayesLattice_g, it is an automatic Bayesian cubature that considers 
% the integrand a realization of a Gaussian process. CubBayesNet_g uses
% Sobol points whereas cubBayesLattice_g uses lattice points.
% 
% 
%% Major changes in publications
% 
% In the folder "Papers", we have added a few recently published research
% articles and theses related to our core algorithms.
% 
% First, we have Rathinavel's PhD thesis that develops the theory
% behind cubBayesLattice_g and CubBayesNet_g.
% 
% In addition, we have included Ding, Hickernell, and Jimenez Rugama's 
% recent paper, An Adaptive Algorithm Employing Continuous Linear 
% Functionals.
