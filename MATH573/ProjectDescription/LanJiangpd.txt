Math 573 Project ProposalLan JiangI have been working on two algorithms. one is called meanMC_g and the other is called cubMC_g. During this summer, I added inline documentation, parameter checking and parsing, description, examples, doctests and unittest for the meanMC algorithm, but the cubMC algorithm is still need to be polished.  Since the cubMC algorithm is already in a semi good shape, which has description, inline documentation, parameter checking and parsing doctest and unittest. I want to  add more doctest and unittest, add some more examples to call this algorithm in order to show people it is useful tool who could give them guaranteed fixed width confidence interval for a integration problem. also, it is already tested in univariate integration, I want to make it more robust for the multidimensional integration, thus, I need to debug and test it , and also make it more efficient.
