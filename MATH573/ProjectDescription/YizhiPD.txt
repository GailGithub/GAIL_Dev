Title: Extent integral_g in GAIL from [0,1] to [a,b]

Decription: integral_g can do integration in interval [0, 1]. We can easily shrink any function on [a, b] to [0, 1]. But this could affect the cone condition from original cone which the function satisfied. Thus, we want to establish a new algorithm of integration in [a, b]. Moreover, if a or b is infinity, what adjustment should be made from a or b being very large? We also need to build the documentation, input parsing, doctests, unit tests, other relative maintenance for this new algorithm.
