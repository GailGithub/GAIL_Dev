Title: RBF-FD: 'Radial basis function' based Finite Difference method for 2D/3D Poisson equation approximation

I have been working on using 'Stable Gaussian RBF method' from the paper
"Stable evaluation of Gaussian RBF interpolants by Gregory e. Fasshauer and Michael j. Mccourt"
for Finite difference methods based on the paper 
"On the optimal shape parameter for Gaussian radial basis function finite difference approximation of the Poisson equation By
Oleg Davydova, Dang Thi Oanhb".

I will use the ideas learnt from this course to make my existing code more reliable and usable.
