Outline and description of my project


The algorithm description

This is a new algorithm after the paper--The Cost of Deterministic, Adaptive, Automatic Algorithm: Cones, Not Balls. The main idea of the algorithm is to approximate the minimum value of the function with an error tolerance. Since it is also a part of my thesis for Master's degree, it will be update with my research and conclusions.
