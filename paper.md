# Summary

Function approximation, integration, and optimization are three fundamental mathematical problems. They are especially challenging when the functions involved fluctuate wildly in certain parts of the domain, or if the domain is high dimensional. Ideally, these algorithms should possess a rigorous mathematical framework, databased (probabilistic) error bounds, and advanced sampling strategies for efficiency.

The Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library (GAIL) is our multi-year research effort directed towards addressing the aforementioned challenge. Briefly, GAIL is a free, open-source MATLAB software library with nine main algorithms undergirded by over a dozen peer-reviewed publications. GAIL solves problems in univariate and multivariate integration, and in univariate function approximation and optimization. GAIL algorithms sample data points of a given function in an adaptive manner and automatically stop when the error tolerance has been reached. In some cases, GAIL algorithms are proven to have asymptotically optimal computational cost. We consistently employ good software development practices for GAIL such as unit tests, searchable online documentation, and git version control. 


# Statement of need
Function approximation, integration, and optimization are fundamental problems requiring numerical solutions. A fundamental question is how and when to stop the computation. Theoretical error bounds typically contain unknown quantities, such as the norm of the input function. This makes them impractical as stopping criteria.

Therefore, practical algorithms that adapt the computation to the error requirement are often based on heuristics. These include a popular adaptive quadrature algorithm of Shampine `[@Sha08a]` that is a part of MATLAB [28] and the Chebfun library [8]. Heuristics based on function data tend to lack theoretical support; one does not know when they work and when they do not. A warning against commonly used adaptive quadrature stopping criteria is given by Lyness [25].



# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
